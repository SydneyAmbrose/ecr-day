# Funding guidelines

This document provides information on funding made available by the AIM RSF for the Early Career Researcher (ECR) Day to take place at the Alan Turing Institute on 23 November 2023.

## Accessibility Fund
We are able to provide an Accessibility Fund to support individuals with specific needs.
This fund is available to a maximum of ten applicants, each eligible for financial assistance of up to £250.
To apply for the Accessibility Fund, it is essential to clearly outline what specific accommodations are required and provide a compelling explanation of why they are needed.
This information ensures that we can best address your unique accessibility requirements and offer the necessary support to make your experience as comfortable and accessible as possible.

## Hotel Expenses
The RSF can arrange hotel accommodation for a maximum of one day, if it was explicitly requested in the registration form.
However, if you applied for the accessibility fund, which includes a request for an extra night, this exception would apply.

## Travel Expenses
**As part of the ECR day arrangements, the RSF is able to subsidise travel costs to a maximum of £150 (incl. VAT) per RSF-funded delegate place.**

RSF team colleagues based at The Alan Turing Institute are responsible for booking travel arrangements to and from the Turing in line with The Alan Turing Institute’s internal Travel and Expenses Policy.

AIM Consortium members are responsible for booking and paying for their own travel arrangements to and from the Turing, and for the prompt completion and submission of expenses claims thereafter (see below for guidance).

Where possible, individual consortia are asked to collate all travel expenses for their research group and to submit a single collective claim to the RSF team for reimbursement.
The RSF will then administer this to the value of £150 (maximum) for each consortium member traveling.

Where possible, the most economic and low-carbon means of travel should be chosen and delegates travelling by train should attempt to reduce the cost of travel by using existing travel cards and discounts.
Claimants traveling by train must also use standard class (unless a cheaper fare is available in first class).

To **claim back your expenses**, we need **three types of files** from you. Please click on the links below to access the files:
- Receipts (images/PDFs): Please include clear photos or copies of your receipts, and include the itemised list version of the receipt where possible.
- Expense form (Excel): Please complete this in the currency of the expense that occurred. If you can’t do this, please note it in the email back to us, and we'll fix it. You need to add your sort code and bank details, date, and Gross Value accurately. If it's not filled in, we won't be able to process your reimbursement.
- Travel & expenses policy (PDF/jpg, signed): We cannot process your expenses without this, so please don't leave it out. All your bank details need to be filled in except for the Name of the Turing Approver/Supervisor. 

**_If you're sending the forms and receipts to RSF team (aimrsf@turing.ac.uk) independently and not through your consortium project manager, please make sure that you use DocuSign and complete all docs.
You should have received an email from DocuSign with all docs._**

*Forms and receipts must be submitted within __3-4 weeks__ to aimrsf@turing.ac.uk by either the Consortium Project Manager or by delegates themselves.
If you are claiming for mileages, please add a Google map showing the mileages and review the Travel policy to find the rate for mileages.*
