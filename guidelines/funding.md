# Funding Guidelines

This document outlines the funding opportunities provided by the AIM RSF (Alan Turing Institute Research Support Fund) for the Early Career Researcher (ECR) Day scheduled for **November 23, 2023,** at the Alan Turing Institute.

## Accessibility Fund
We are delighted to offer an Accessibility Fund designed to support individuals with specific needs. This fund extends to a maximum of ten applicants, each eligible for financial assistance of up to £250. To apply for the Accessibility Fund, it is essential to clearly articulate your specific accommodation requirements and provide a compelling explanation of why these accommodations are necessary. Additionally, please confirm your ability to provide receipts. This information enables us to tailor our support to ensure your experience is as comfortable and accessible as possible. Examples of accessibility needs may include childcare, an extra night's stay at a hotel due to caregiving responsibilities, and more.

## Hotel Expenses
The RSF can arrange hotel accommodation for a maximum of one day if explicitly requested in the registration form. However, if you have applied for the accessibility fund, which includes a request for an additional night, this exception will apply.

## Travel Expenses
**As part of the ECR Day arrangements, the RSF is pleased to offer a travel cost subsidy of up to £150 (inclusive of VAT) per ECR.**

The RSF team, based at The Alan Turing Institute, will manage the booking of travel arrangements to and from the Turing, in compliance with The Alan Turing Institute’s internal Travel and Expenses Policy.

There are two options for reimbursement:

- If the ECR are purchasing tickets through their internal institution system, individual consortia are asked to collate all travel expenses for their research group and to submit a single collective claim to the RSF team for reimbursement via the three forms (not through a purchase order). Consortia will need to fill them only once. The value of the ticket should be in alignment with Turing Travel policy. RSF will then administer this to the value of £150 (maximum) for each consortium member traveling.

- If the ECR is paying on their own, each will need to submit individually by filling in the 3 forms below.

Please note if the consortia is paying for travel expenses through their internal system and can't fill in the forms and will need to invoice us through a Purchase Order, AIM RSF (aimrsf@turing.ac.uk) need to be notified by the 14th of Sept to discuss the options.

Whenever feasible, we encourage individual consortia to consolidate all travel expenses for their research group and submit a single collective claim to the RSF team for reimbursement. The RSF will then process reimbursements up to the value of £150 for each consortium member who traveled.

In line with our commitment to sustainability, we strongly recommend selecting the most cost-effective and environmentally friendly means of travel. Delegates traveling by train should explore cost-saving options, such as utilizing existing travel cards and discounts. Claimants traveling by train must use standard class unless a cheaper fare in first class is available.

To initiate the **expenses reimbursement process**, we require **three types of documents** from you. Please click on the links below to access the necessary files:

- **Receipts (images/PDFs):** Include clear photos or copies of your receipts, ensuring that the itemized list version of the receipt is visible where available.

- **[Expense form (Excel)](https://az659834.vo.msecnd.net/eventsairwesteuprod/production-uobevents-public/2662fbd88e3f40e09d5f4bc3ab9ae9c5):** Complete this form in the currency corresponding to the expense. If this is not possible, please indicate this in your email to us, and we will assist you. Ensure accurate inclusion of your sort code, bank details, date, and Gross Value. Incomplete forms will result in processing delays.

- **[Travel & Expenses Policy (PDF/jpg, signed)](https://az659834.vo.msecnd.net/eventsairwesteuprod/production-uobevents-public/55742e599b004367b24d306d7ad73916):** This document is essential for processing your expenses; therefore, please do not omit it. Ensure all bank details are filled in, with the exception of the Name of the Turing Approver/Supervisor.

**_If you are sending the forms and receipts to the RSF team (aimrsf@turing.ac.uk) independently, rather than through your consortium project manager, please utilize DocuSign and complete all documents. You should have received an email from DocuSign containing all the necessary documents._**

*Forms and receipts must be submitted to aimrsf@turing.ac.uk within __3 weeks__ from the conclusion of your travel. Submissions can be made by either the Consortium Project Manager or individual delegates. If you are claiming mileage expenses, please include a Google map displaying the mileage calculation, and consult the Travel policy for mileage rates.*
